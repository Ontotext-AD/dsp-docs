Probably the highest profile application of semantic technology to date, BBCâ€™s 2010 World Cup web site was delivered using the OWLIM Enterprise semantic repository. A famous "call to action" by John O'Donovan (Chief Technical Architect, BBC) has spurred a flurry of semantic technology activity in world-known media companies, particularly in the UK and US.

A leading international business-to-business publisher, focused primarily on international finance, Euromoney chose Ontotext to develop a unified semantic publishing platform to bridge the information gaps between over 100 business units.  As a result, the business units will not only be able to more quickly create content, but, having access to all historical content within all groups, will make for better, more enriched content.

In an unprecedented move among competitors, all daily newspaper publishers from the Netherlands joined together with the goal of creating a next generation semantic tagging platform.  Ontotext and our partners Dayon were tasked with developing this system, which included the sourcing of third-party data sets and the engineering of text analytics systems to improve the efficiency of content generation.

Siemens and their partner Publicis set out to build a semantic tagging framework, and sought Ontotext's vast media industry experience in this area.  The daunting goal for these two organizations was to change the way journalists and copywriters create broader content.

Utilizing Ontotext's technologies and experience, the project was big success, resulting in better content.  Now, every paragraph submitted to the system through the WYSIWYG editor generates a query which returns relevant content from the Siemens' content silos. The result is stories that provide more insight and a deeper, more analytical viewpoint.
