We have been working on the semantic annotation and indexing stack for 15 years, constantly refining and modernizing the algorithms and the platform itself, turning it into a mature and well-integrated semantic publishing stack. These are some of our customer success stories.

Probably the highest profile application of semantic technology to date, [BBC’s](http://bbc.co.uk) <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/groups_and_teams/team/germany/thomas_mueller">
2010 World Cup web site</a> was delivered using the OWLIM Enterprise semantic repository (now [GraphDB](http://ontotext.com/products/ontotext-graphdb/)). A famous "call to action" by John O'Donovan (Chief Technical Architect, BBC) has spurred a flurry of semantic technology activity in world-known media companies, particularly in the UK and US.

A leading international business-to-business publisher, focused primarily on international finance, [Euromoney](http://www.euromoney.com/) chose Ontotext to develop a unified semantic publishing platform to bridge the information gaps between over 100 business units.  As a result, the business units will not only be able to more quickly create content, but, having access to all historical content within all groups, will make for better, more enriched content.

[The Financial Times](ft.com) has a reputation for being an innovator in the field of news publishing. They have embraced a “universal publishing” strategy. Ontotext's [GraphDB Enterprise Edition](http://ontotext.com/products/ontotext-graphdb/) was chosen as the only triplestore that can perform semantic inference at scale. GraphDB handles massive loads, queries and inferencing in real time. Its connectors for full-text search and NoSQL further improved performance. The 'Related Reads' was the first product developed on top of the GraphDB architecture. 'Related Reads' makes use of the content's semantic metadata and the modelling of user activity to suggest contextually and behaviourally relevant articles.

[The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)](http://www.theiet.org/) is a world leading professional organization sharing and advancing knowledge to promote science, engineering and technology across the world. The IET chose Ontotext to build a pilot system using semantic metadata coupled with text analysis and machine learning to enrich their publishing assets and Inspec thesaurus. In addition, the IET was keen to explore the possibility of mixing their internal datasets with external ones to augment value. Ontotext is currently working with the IET to turn the pilot system into a commercial serving offering.

The producer of 40% of all news in the UK, the [Press Association](https://www.pressassociation.com/) chose Ontotext's Semantic Publishing technology to enrich the news content that it provides  to syndicated news clients.  As a result of this successful effort, the Press Association and Ontotext technology were chosen to be the official news provider for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.  Our tools the Press Association to rapidly generate relevant news from the Olympics by providing valuable information on all aspects of the games including the athletes, the individual events and the participating countries.

In an unprecedented move among competitors, all daily newspaper publishers from the Netherlands joined together with the goal of creating a next generation semantic tagging platform.  Ontotext and our partners Dayon were tasked with developing this system, which included the sourcing of third-party data sets and the engineering of text analytics systems to improve the efficiency of content generation.

[Siemens](http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/) and their partner [Publicis](http://www.publicisgroupe.com/site/index.jsp?language=EN) set out to build a semantic tagging framework, and sought Ontotext's vast media industry experience in this area.  The daunting goal for these two organizations was to change the way journalists and copywriters create broader content.

Utilizing Ontotext's technologies and experience, the project was big success, resulting in better content.  Now, every paragraph submitted to the system through the WYSIWYG editor generates a query which returns relevant content from the Siemens' content silos. The result is stories that provide more insight and a deeper, more analytical viewpoint.
