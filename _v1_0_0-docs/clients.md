In an unprecedented move among competitors, all daily newspaper publishers from the Netherlands joined together with the goal of creating a next generation semantic tagging platform.  Ontotext and our partners Dayon were tasked with developing this system, which included the sourcing of third-party data sets and the engineering of text analytics systems to improve the efficiency of content generation.

Siemens and their partner Publicis set out to build a semantic tagging framework, and sought Ontotext's vast media industry experience in this area.  The daunting goal for these two organizations was to change the way journalists and copywriters create broader content.
Utilizing Ontotext's technologies and experience, the project was big success, resulting in better content.  Now, every paragraph submitted to the system through the WYSIWYG editor generates a query which returns relevant content from the Siemens' content silos. The result is stories that provide more insight and a deeper, more analytical viewpoint.
