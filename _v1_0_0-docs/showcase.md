News on the Web (NOW) is a showcase of the Dynamic Semantic Publishing (DSP) Platform.

It both relies on metadata and produces rich metadata to еnable dynamic creation of custom content streams, content reuse and re-purposing, and user tailored recommendations.

All metadata is represented in RDF and is stored in our GraphDB database. In this showcase, we have combined DBPedia 2015, WikiData, and GeoNames to create a high-coverage general purpose dataset, containing over 4 million People, Locations, Organizations, Animals, Plants and other Things.

Find out what is possible with [News on the Web (NOW)](http://now.ontotext.com) and share your thoughts. We’ve built it not only as a showcase for dynamic semantic publishing but also as a place where we will experiment with new features and approaches, and engage you as equal partners on the level of ideas and insights.
