The Semantic Publishing Platform with its customizations in media, academic, scientific publishing, and education verticals is a component-based solution for building semantic content management and authoring, semantic search, analytics and visualization systems.

At the heart of Ontotext Semantic Publishing Platform is a knowledge base, GraphDB™, used to store and organize publishers’ content and metadata. Leveraging this knowledge base is a complete set of semantic services to enable better search and content discovery, automated and dynamic generation of products and increased content reuse through intelligent content association.
With the help of Ontotext Semantic Publishing Platform publishers are able to offer personalized recommendations for authors, researchers and content consumers, which eliminate content data silos to allow sharing and remixing of content across an organisation.

Ontotext has successfully integrated this solution with major content management systems creating a seamless user experience. By building Semantic Publishing Platform with recognized open standards, our clients have the reassurance that they are avoiding costly 'vendor lock-in' scenarios.
