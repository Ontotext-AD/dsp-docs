All metadata, represented in RDF, is stored in our GraphDB™ database. GraphDB is an RDF Triplestore built on Ontology Web Language standards. It stores data in the form of atomic facts expressed as subjects, predicates and objects, which have relationships to other facts. It stores the DSP Platform's consolidated entity profiles, bibliographic records and subject terms.

For more details, see the [GraphDB™ Documentation](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/).
