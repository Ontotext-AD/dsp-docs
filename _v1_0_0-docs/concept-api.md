The Concept API is the part of the Ontotext Publishing Platform responsible for operations with RDF Objects such as Concepts (or named entities), Documents and Channels. We view every RDF object as a concept, hence the API name.

For more details, see [Concept API Documentation](http://ontotext-ad.github.io/concept-pub-docs/).
